                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Alfredo Salayandia.
                    I'm a multi-faceted professional with a diverse background that includes 3 years of experience in
                    concrete finishing,
                    1 year as a sandblaster, various roles in warehouse operations, and 6 months of dedicated web
                    development.
                </p>

                    My Journey
                </p>
                <p>
                    My career has been a journey of growth and adaptability. I began as a concrete finisher, mastering
                    the
                    art of preparing and perfecting concrete surfaces. Transitioning into sandblasting, I honed my
                    skills in surface preparation and equipment maintenance. Warehouse jobs provided me with valuable
                    lessons in organization and teamwork. These experiences have laid a strong foundation for my
                    professional development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the last 6 months, I've embarked on a new adventure in web development. I've dived into the
                    ever-evolving world of coding, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring various web
                    development frameworks. My goal is to combine my practical skills with my newfound web development
                    expertise to create innovative digital solutions.
